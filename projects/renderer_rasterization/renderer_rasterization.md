# Rasterization-based renderer

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to write rasterization-based rendering engine.

Course lectures covering the topic:
1. Rendering: introduction
2. Rendering: rasterization

Based on: https://learnopengl.com/

## Prerequistes:

1. Knowledge of programming language: e.g., C++, Python, etc.
2. OpenGL API: https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL
* OpenGL setup: https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window
* GLFW and GLAD setup: https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window

GLM

GLM stands for OpenGL Mathematics and is a header-only library, which means that we only have to include the proper header files and we're done; no linking and compiling necessary. GLM can be downloaded from their website. Copy the root directory of the header files into this directory.
* GLM website: https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html

After OpenGL has been setup, compile and run `opengl_test.cpp` to see if everything is running correctly. The result should be black screen - which is expected since nothing is being rendered.

## Tasks

### Window and main rendering loop

Main file containing window and rendering loop is `opengl_renderer_main.cpp`.
